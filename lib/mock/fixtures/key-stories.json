		"situation": "During a backend internship, a customer-facing API experienced intermittent latency spikes after a traffic increase, affecting multiple dependent services and triggering alerts during peak business hours.",
		"task": "Identify the root cause of the latency regression and restore stable performance without introducing further downtime or risky architectural changes.",
		"action": "I analyzed traces and metrics, correlated latency with cache eviction patterns, and reproduced the issue locally. I proposed adjusting cache TTLs and adding targeted indexes, then coordinated a staged rollout with monitoring and rollback plans.",
		"result": "P95 latency dropped by 38% and error rates normalized within a day. The fix was adopted as a standard configuration, and the incident report was shared internally as a learning reference.",
		"emotion": "Initially stressed by the production impact, I felt focused and later quietly confident after validating the fix under load.",
