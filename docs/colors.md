# UI Colour Palette

This document defines a colour palette inspired by the Leaply logo for use throughout the application.  Using a consistent palette helps maintain brand identity and visual cohesion.

## Primary colours

- **Leaf Green**: `#95CA55`  
  Derived from the green leaf in the logo. Use as the primary accent colour for buttons, active states and key highlights.
- **Dark Grey**: `#3F3C3B`  
  Matches the dark text in the logo. Use for primary text and headings.

## Secondary colours

- **Light Grey**: `#F5F5F5`  
  Neutral background for panels and sections. Keeps interfaces airy and reduces contrast fatigue.
- **Mid Grey**: `#6D6866`  
  Use for secondary text, borders and muted elements.
- **Light Green**: `#B9DA7A`  
  A lighter tint of the primary green for hover states or subtle highlights.

## Accent colours

- **Sky Blue**: `#4CA8D3`  
  Optional accent for links or information messages. Blue complements green and conveys trust.
- **Warning Orange**: `#E8A634`  
  For alerts and warnings (e.g., approaching deadlines). Use sparingly.

## Usage guidelines

1. The primary green should be used for the most important interactive elements: primary buttons, active navigation items and progress bars.
2. The dark grey should be the default colour for high‑contrast text. Mid grey is suitable for secondary text such as captions or descriptions.
3. Use light grey backgrounds to create separation between content sections without hard borders.
4. Reserve accent colours for statuses or messages (e.g., blue for informational alerts, orange for warnings). Avoid overusing accent colours to prevent clutter.
5. Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background to meet accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA or higher). Check colour contrast ratios when creating new UI elements.
